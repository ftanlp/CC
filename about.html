                The Conservation Compendium is a resource for understanding
                various conservation conditions affecting different materials.
                This will help you identify the issues your collection is facing
                and help you when consulting a conservator about what treatment 
                might be required.
                The details provided should not replace consultation with a
                trained conservator, but to empower you to begin your journey in
                the art and science of caring for your collections.
