                The Conservation Compendium is a resource for finding out more about
                various conservation conditions affecting different materials.
                This will help you identify the issues your collection is facing
                and when consulting a conservator about what treatment 
                might be required. This is still a work-in-progress site which will 
                be updated with more information. Reach out if you'd like to be part of 
                this project!
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                The information found here provided should never replace consultation with a
                trained conservator, but to empower you to begin your journey in
                the art and science of caring for your collections.
