                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p class="condition-description">
                    Another word for fungi; mould spores can germinate and grow within organic materials to cause staining and structural weakening. 
                    May appear as colourful powdery or downy growth on an object’s surface, or as black spots.
                    Potentially hazardous as inhalation of active mould spores can result in respiratory complications -- be sure to wear masks and work with a fume hood and protective equipment if suspected to be active mould.
                </p>
                <h3>Treatment Notes</h3>
                <p class="treatment-notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>If it is an active mould (smears instead of powders), ensure staff who is handling takes necessary precautions to avoid ingestion.</li>
                        <li></li>Control of temperature and humidity to keep mould dormant</ul>li>
                        <li>Surface cleaning using HEPA vacuum and erasers provided surface is stable enough</li>
                        <li>Local application of water:ethanol solution may also help in inactivating residual spores after surface cleaning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
