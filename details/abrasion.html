                    A gradual loss of surface material due to rubbing, scraping, or wear. 
                    An abrasion may look like a roughened surface, a matte area, or a group of scratches. 
                    It may be done intentionally to smooth or clean a surface or it may be unintentional caused by poor housing, resulting in damage.
