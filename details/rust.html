                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p class="condition-description">
                    Coating or film on metal caused by oxidation. The term is predominately used to describe the reddish, brittle coating that forms on the surface of iron and iron alloys 
                    due to the metal's oxidation in the presence of water or moisture. This coating is composed of iron oxide (Fe2O3) and hydrated iron oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O3). While metal is 
                    the primary material it affects, rust is brittle and flaky and may leave stains on the other medium the metal comes in contact with.

                <h3>Treatment Notes</h3>
                <p class="treatment-notes">
                    <ul>
                        <li>If not essential for the artefact, remove the fastener causing the rust damage and do surface cleaning.</li>
                        <li>For metallic objects, removal of the rust may cause structural damage and should only be undertaken if deemed necessary and after analysis of the extent of rust</li>
                    </ul>
